## Transforming the Classroom

Face-to-face courses often feel large, intimidating and anonymous. It's hard to feel invested
in multiple choice quizzes, textbook chapters and hum-drum Q &amp; A forums where you
don't know anyone.

In a stellar learning experience, you'd know who was in the room and feel super-comfy.
You'd make projects together and find help when you get stuck. You'd want to send people
thank-you cards and chicken soup.

We know designing a creative, participatory community can be tricky. We're here to help
you **craft assignments** that rule, **build an audience** and support you along the way. You'll
even learn a few technical skills in the process. Don't worry, 1s and 0s wash off
pretty easily.
